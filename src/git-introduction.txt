  GitHub lets you (and others) work together on projects.

github features-
1.easy project management
2.improve code write
3.secure
4.

1.you don't have any code
    1-git clone                                //copy master file
    2-git checkout -b branch-name              //create a new branch
    3-git status                               //check which file changed 
    4-git add .                                //add file locally (here "." //means all files)
    5-git add src/pages/home.js                //add particular file
    6-git commit -m "message"                  //all changes commit
    7-git push origin branch-name              //push commit files on github

2.if you are work all ready created branch
    1-git checkout branch-name                 //move to existing branch
    2-git fetch --all                          //fetch all branch from github
    3-git pull origin branch-name              //all the changes implements in current branch
    4-git status
    5-git add .
    6-git commit -m "some-message"
    7-git push origin branch-name

3.how to create child branch from sub branch
    1-git checkout branch-name
    2-git checkout -b (new branch name) (sub branch name)        //create a child branch from sub branch (ex. git checkout -b child-table parent-table)
    3-git push origin new branch name                            //a new branch push remote server (github) (ex. git push origin child-table) 
    
    git flow = main
                |
            1.parent-table -> child-table
            2.parent-notification

    (here, we have "main branch" and main branch inside a two sub branch 1st "parent-table" and 2nd "parent-notification" and also 1st "parent-table" branch inside child branch "child-table")

4.if some create a new branch and this new branch inside a new folder so how to get this new branch and new files
    1-git checkout branch-name                 //move to another branch
    2-git fetch --all                          //fetch all old and new branch
    3-git pull origin branch name              //all the new changes and new files updated in your current active branch


git branch --all                                //list of your local branch
git init
git remote -v                                   //check which origin connect
git branch -D branch-name                       //delete local branch
git push origin --delete branch-name            //delete remote branch (github)

5.if i am on branch1 and some changes on this branch and then commit "1st change" and does not push the code 
    and i move branch2 and commit and push the code and again move branch1 and again some changes then again commit "2nd change" and now i push branch1 code
    so both commit push on remote server (github)


3.if i have push any branch so this branch push on checkout branch not a main branch
